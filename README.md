# Borderline Explorer

Website layouts nowadays became increasingly complex, not always exactly matching the layout of the rendered page. This extension utilises rather “low tech” method of visualising this architectures - additional stylesheet is enqueued, that contains rules, that draw border around every rendered element, revealing their true position and dimensions. Customisable colour coding denotes different types of web page elements, helping to gain insight into overall composition of a web page.

This extension is a part of [“Under deconstruction: hidden visuality of the web“](https://k00lthing.github.io/under-deconstruction) master thesis fineshide in 2024 at the [University of Arts Bremen](https://www.hfk-bremen.de/).
